# Seasonal Trends

This project “Seasonal Trends” aims to analyze the dataset to see seasonal sales 
and how items in each category have been selling in that season by visualizing it 
using graphs such as Histograms, Pie charts, or Bar graphs and provide detailed information 
to help users with decision-making in restocking or make some promotion of it.
